# iTop-SoftwareInstance-Service

A add Service finalClass to Software Instance

This very small extension add a 'Service' Final class to 'SoftwareInstance'. This is probably a very 'specific' use.

The idea is to set in iTop the 'Services' as systemd services on linux, with dependencies to other softwares, as possible when using this other extension [iTop Sofrware Dependencies](https://github.com/Schirrms/iTop-Software-Dependencies)

That's because often a single service deploys more than one software, and the 'logical' group is the service.

## Todo:

Ã¦dd some nice screenshots of the whole in place ðŸ™‚
